Rcpp 0.11.2 looks to be ready. Running the script summarizing results
straight out of its repo:

The scripts contains more details and comments. It reflects a complete test
over all CRAN packages (modulo just three skipped ones, see below).

The script, patches, summary (as well as old release checks) are in the
repository at https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs


Current state:
--------------

Rcpp development sources for the upcoming release 0.11.2 are in the GitHub
repo

    https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp

and build and test fine.  

The rest of this post is about how this version fares relative to existing
CRAN packages with a reverse dependency on Rcpp.


Good packages: Works "As Is"
----------------------------

The vast majority of packages -- 202 in total as of today, up from 152 and
177 for the previous releases -- build as-is under the upcoming Rcpp releease,
including 'R CMD check' which is very satisfying.


Good packages: Open question
----------------------------

As before, the msgl package stops under tests / example since Rcpp 0.11.0.  The
maintainer has been contacted; we have not heard back.

The very new package rlme fails in one of its regression tests. At this point
it is not clear if this is a side-effect of changes between Rcpp 0.11.1 and
0.11.2, or something in the rlme package.

Bad/unknown: Not Rcpp
---------------------

Fourteen packages failed because not all required Depends were loaded:

CARBayes:       builds, bombs in examples on "Error in library(shapes) : there is no package called ‘shapes’"
DNAprofiles:    builds, bombs in examples on "there is no package called ‘DNAtools’"
dplyr:          builds, bombs in examples on "there is no package called 'RSQLite.extfuns'"
FisHiCal:       builds, bombs in examples on lack of rgl device
HUM:		builds, bombs in examples on lack of rgl device
KernSmoothIRT:  builds, bombs in examples on lack of rgl device
Morpho:         builds, bombs in examples on "Error in library(shapes) : there is no package called ‘shapes’"
pROC:           builds, bombs in examples on "there is no package called ‘logcondens’"
rARPACK:	possibly transient error in static library from ARPACK code not recognised
Reot:           builds, bombs in examples on "Error in library(gridExtra) : there is no package called ‘gridExtra’"
SpatialEpi:     lack spdep which may have failed for another reason
surveillance:   builds, bombs in examples:  ‘there is no package called ‘spc’’
tbart:          builds, bombs in examples:  there is no package called ‘GISTools’
wsrf:           builds, bombs in examples:  there is no package called ‘rattle’ 



Bad: Cannot complete test
-------------------------

We skip the WideLM package as we do not have a working CUDA setup right now.



Summary
=======

We consider Rcpp ready for release.
