=======================================


Summary

Rcpp 0.11.1 looks to be ready. Running the script summarizing results
straight out of its repo:

The scripts contains more details and comments. It reflects a complete test
over all CRAN packages (modulo just three skipped ones, see below).

The script, patches, summary (as well as old release checks) are in the
repository at https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs


Current state:
--------------

Rcpp development sources for the upcoming release 0.11.1 are in the GitHub
repo

    https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp

and build and test fine.  

The rest of this post is about how this version fares relative to existing
CRAN packages with a reverse dependency on Rcpp.


Good packages: Works "As Is"
----------------------------

The vast majority of packages -- 177 in total as of today, up from 152 for
the previous release -- build as-is under the upcoming Rcpp releease,
including 'R CMD check' which is very satisfying.  


Good packages: Open question
----------------------------

The msgl package stops under tests / example since Rcpp 0.11.0.  The
maintainer has been contacted; we have not heard back.


Bad/unknown: Not Rcpp
---------------------

lme4 fails over a test; this has been said to be due to an interaction with
the testthat package. Morpho fails as it wants to load a package from its
Suggests:.


Bad: Cannot complete test
-------------------------

As before, we have excluded the quadrupen package as its test appears to run
for hours on end.  

We skip the dplyr packages which builds, but fails in tests, examples and
vignette unless all of its Suggests are installed. That is a violation of the
suggestion in Section 1.1.3 of Writing R Extensions: as 'Suggests' are not
'Depends'. We install the latter; and hundreds of packages work with just
Depends. The dplyr should too.

We skip the WideLM package as we do not have a working CUDA setup.



Summary
=======

We consider Rcpp ready for release.
