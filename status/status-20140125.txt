The scripts contains more details and comments. It reflect twelve days of
testing, patching and refinements following an initial batch test on Jan 12.

The script, patches, summary (as well as old release checks) are in the
repository at https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs


Current state:
--------------

Rcpp development sources are in the GitHub repo 

    https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp

and build and test fine.  The rest of this post is about how this version
fares relative to existing CRAN releases.


Good packages: Works "As Is"
----------------------------

The vast majority of packages -- 135 in total -- builds as-is under the
upcoming Rcpp releease, including 'R CMD check' which is very satisfying.


Good packages: Need an Imports / importFrom update
--------------------------------------------------

Fifteen packages need to 

    i)  add   Imports: Rcpp               to DESCRIPTION

    ii) add   importFrom(Rcpp, evalCpp)   to NAMESPACE

Note that just adding import(Rcpp) does not suffice.

We have provided patches in this Github repo / directory:

    https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs/tree/master/patches/2014-01

for the following packages

    CDM-2.4-9.patch
    fdaMixed-0.3.patch
    gRbase-1.6-12.patch
    gRim-0.1-17.patch
    HLMdiag-0.2.3.patch
    lme4-1.05.patch
    openair-0.9-0.patch
    rgam-0.6.2.patch
    Ruchardet-0.0-2.patch
    Rvcg-0.6-3.patch
    SBSA-0.2.2.patch
    sirt-0.41-21.patch
    SpatialTools-0.5.5.patch
    strum-0.1.patch
    TAM-1.0-0.patch


Good packages: Need another update / fix
----------------------------------------

Six packages need to apply a minimal change to their include files and
order (in essence: include just Rcpp.h, or RcppArmadillo.h, and no other
Rcpp* headers as this can often derail some internal interdependencies).

We have provided patches in this Github repo / directory:

    https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs/tree/master/patches/2014-01

for the following package

    httpuv-1.2.1.patch

A few of our packages needed fixes as well, we have updated them in their
respective R-Forge or GitHub repos:

    RcppClassic
    RcppEigen   
    RcppZiggurat
    RQuantLib

and plan to make new releases in the next few days.

The dplyr package is already fixed in its repo as well.

Special thanks to Alexios who already applied patches to rugarch and rmgarch,
and uploaded those new versions to CRAN.


Good packages: Open question
----------------------------

Amelia builds, and tests file -- but loops forever in one segment in the
vignette.  This may or may not be related to Rcpp. We have contacted the
maintainer, but not yet heard back.


Bad/unknown packages: Missing Depends on BioConductor
-----------------------------------------------------

Four packages were not tested as their Depends included BioConductor packages:

     GeneticTools GOsummaries orQA snplist 


Bad/unknown: Not Rcpp
---------------------

Two packages had other issues:

     ALDqr     needs a \dontrun{} in one example
     roxygen2  does not terminate its unit test


Bad/skipped: Not tested
-----------------------

We excluded the quadrupen package as its test appears to run for hours on
end.


BioConductor
------------

Kevin also tested the sixteen or so BioConductor packages, see 

     https://github.com/kevinushey/RcppBiocChecks

One package needs one of our fixed packages, another fails with an include
issue similar to the one reported above -- and the rest passes.


Summary
=======

We consider Rcpp ready for release.
