The scripts contains more details and comments. It reflect two weeks of
testing, patching and refinements following an initial batch test on Jan 12.

The script, patches, summary (as well as old release checks) are in the
repository at https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs


Current state:
--------------

Rcpp development sources are in the GitHub repo 

    https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp

and build and test fine.  

The rest of this post is about how this version fares relative to existing
CRAN packages with a reverse dependency on Rcpp.


Good packages: Works "As Is"
----------------------------

The vast majority of packages -- 152 in total as of today -- build as-is
under the upcoming Rcpp releease, including 'R CMD check' which is very
satisfying.  A big thank you to everybody who patched or otherwise updated
their package.


Good packages: Need an Imports / importFrom update
--------------------------------------------------

A small number o packages need to 

    i)  add   Imports: Rcpp               to DESCRIPTION

    ii) add   importFrom(Rcpp, evalCpp)   to NAMESPACE

Note that just adding import(Rcpp) does not suffice.

We have provided patches in this Github repo / directory:

    https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs/tree/master/patches/2014-01

for the following packages

    gRbase-1.6-12.patch
    gRim-0.1-17.patch
    lme4-1.05.patch
    Ruchardet-0.0-2.patch
    strum-0.1.patch
    TAM-1.0-0.patch

I will also contact each of these maintainers by email.

Special thanks to maintainers who patched their packages already.


Good packages: Need another update / fix
----------------------------------------

N/A.

When we started, a few packages needed to apply a minimal change to their
include files and order (in essence: include just Rcpp.h, or
RcppArmadillo.h, and no other Rcpp* headers as this can often derail some
internal interdependencies).

A few of our packages neededed fixes as well, we first updated them in their
respective R-Forge or GitHub repos, and have since uploaded them to CRAN:
RQuantLib, RcppClassic, RcppEigen, RcppZiggurat as well as an earlier change
in RProtoBuf

Special thanks to Alexios who already applied patches to rugarch and rmgarch,
and uploaded those new versions to CRAN, to Martin Vincent who relaxed a
test condition in his sglOptim and uploaded it to CRAN, and to Joe Cheng for
an update to httpuv.


Good packages: Open question
----------------------------

Amelia builds, and tests fine -- but loops forever in one segment in the
vignette.  After discussing this with Matt it was concluded that this is
probably an Amelia issue.


Gut but initially skipped packages: Depends on BioConductor
-----------------------------------------------------------

Four packages were not tested initially as their Depends included
BioConductor packages:

     GeneticTools GOsummaries orQA snplist 

However, Kevin tested these as part of his test against all of BioConductor.
As they passed, we added them to 'works as-is' as well.


Bad/unknown: Not Rcpp
---------------------

N/A


Bad: Cannot complete test
-------------------------

As before, we have excluded the quadrupen package as its test appears to run
for hours on end.  

We also skip the dplyr packages which builds, but fails in tests, examples
and vignette unless all of its Suggests are installed. To us, that is a
violation of the suggestion in Section 1.1.3 of Writing R Extensions. 


BioConductor
------------

Kevin also tested the sixteen or so BioConductor packages, see 

     https://github.com/kevinushey/RcppBiocChecks

One package needs one of our fixed packages, another fails with an include
issue similar to the one reported above -- and the rest passes.


Summary
=======

We consider Rcpp ready for release.  

Per discussion with CRAN, we plan to upload Rcpp in a week from giving
maintainers time to apply the patches we prepared.



Appendix
--------

There is also a run-time issue.  We recommend to reinstall all packages that
use Rcpp.  A helper script is provided at 

   https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs/blob/master/scripts/showReverseRcppDepends.r

which lists installed package that use Rcpp, and for which current sources
are (or are not) currently available on CRAN and its mirrors.
