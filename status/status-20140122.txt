The scripts contains more details and comments. It reflect ten days of
testing, patching and refinements following an initial batch test on Jan 12.


Current state:
--------------

Rcpp development sources are in the GitHub repo 

    https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp

and build and test fine.  The rest of this post is about how this version
fares relative to existing CRAN releases.


Good packages: Works "As Is"
----------------------------

The vast majority of packages builds as-is under the upcoming Rcpp releease,
including 'R CMD check' which is very satisfying.


Good packages: Need an Imports / importFrom update
--------------------------------------------------

Twelve packages need to 

    i)  add   Imports: Rcpp               to DESCRIPTION

    ii) add   importFrom(Rcpp, evalCpp)   to NAMESPACE

Note that just adding import(Rcpp) does not suffice.

We have provided patches in this Github repo / directory:

    https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs/tree/master/patches/2014-01

for the following packages

    fdaMixed-0.3.patch
    gRbase-1.6-12.patch
    gRim-0.1-17.patch
    HLMdiag-0.2.3.patch
    lme4-1.05.patch
    openair-0.9-0.patch
    rgam-0.6.2.patch
    Ruchardet-0.0-2.patch
    Rvcg-0.6-3.patch
    SBSA-0.2.2.patch
    SpatialTools-0.5.5.patch
    strum-0.1.patch


Good packages: Need another update / fix
----------------------------------------

Three packages need to apply a minimal change to their include files and
order (in essence: include just Rcpp.h, or RcppArmadillo.h, and no other
Rcpp* headers as this can often derail some internal interdependencies).

We have provided patches in this Github repo / directory:

    https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-logs/tree/master/patches/2014-01

for the following packages

    httpuv-1.2.1.patch
    rmgarch-1.2-0.patch
    rugarch-1.2-9.patch

A few of our packages needed fixes as well, we have updated them in their
respective R-Forge or GitHub repos:

    RcppClassic
    RcppEigen   
    RcppZiggurat
    RQuantLib

and plan to make new releases in the next few days.

The sglOptim packages passes just fine, but balks at one unit test with a
rather tight test criterion.  The maintainer intends to upload a new version
with a relaxed test.


Good packages: Open question
----------------------------

Amelia builds, and tests file -- but loops forever in one segment in the
vignette.  This may or may not be related to Rcpp. We have contacted the
maintainer, but not yet heard back.


Bad/unknown packages: Missing Depends
-------------------------------------

Fifteen packages were not tested as their Depends were not installed here:

     CARBayes CDM classify diversitree geiger GeneticTools GOsummaries
     hypervolume kmc orQA sirt snplist surveillance TAM tbart

We would welcome if it their maintainers, or other volunteers, could test
them.


Bad/unknown: Not Rcpp
---------------------

Two packages had other issues:

     ALDqr     needs a \dontrun{} in one example
     roxygen2  does not terminate its unit test


Not tested
----------

We excluded the quadrupen package as its test appears to run for hours on
end.


BioConductor
------------

Kevin also tested the sixteen or so BioConductor packages, see 

     https://github.com/kevinushey/RcppBiocChecks

One package needs one of our fixed packages, another fails with an include
issue similar to the one reported above -- and the rest passes.


Summary
=======

We consider Rcpp ready for release.
