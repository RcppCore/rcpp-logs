64 passed

3 with issues: FisHiCal, Morpho, msggl -- see below

FisHiCal:
   builds and tests fine 
   aborts in examples when no RGL device is available

Morpho:
   builds and tests fine
   an example aborts on "there is no package called ‘shapes’"

msgl:
   as in previous tests, stops on one regression test prediction which may be too tight?

In sum, RcppArmadillo is ready.
