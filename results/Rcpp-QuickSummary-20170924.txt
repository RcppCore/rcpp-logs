DETAILS 
=======

New spurious issue
-------------------

"castor"           	version 1.1.0 passed, now 1.2.0 has error, and 1.2.1 passes again

"sirt"                  need ic.infer; passes once installed

"countoureR"            qhull internal error 

"wsrf"                  relies on unexported rattle object


Failed Before
-------------

"brms"			likely internal: "Failure: plotting functions don't throw unexpected errors" [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"climdex.pcic"		possible internal test failure [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"ConConPiWiFun"         test failure, segfault, unclear [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"icosa"                 test failure [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"kerpg"			test failure
                           Error in optim(par = parIni, fn = thisLogLikFun, gr = thisLogLikGrad,  : 
                             L-BFGS-B needs finite values of 'fn'
                           Error in .local(object, ...) : error in 'optim'

"officer"		testthat failure, reason unclear

"rstan"                 known BH issue

"rstanarm"              possibly internal:  Error in new_CppObject_xp(fields$.module, fields$.pointer, ...) : no valid constructor available for the argument list [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"VeryLargeIntegers"     possibly internal: segfault [also with CRAN Rcpp]


"Wmisc"                 possibly internal test failure [also with CRAN Rcpp]


SUMMARY
=======

Rcpp should be fine
