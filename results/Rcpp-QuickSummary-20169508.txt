SUMMARY
=======

One potential and new issue in 'futureheatwaves' we will look into

Several 'doh' issues by (temporarily) not having libgsl-dev installed

Several 'this package is needed' issue we have seen before

Several known previous failures

No other issues related to Rcpp as far as we can tell
