Of those ten

  - eight we have seen [in some cases many times] before and which do NOT appear to be related to recent changes
  - one possible new issue (hBayesDM)
  - one spurious (mvnfast)

  
DETAILS
=======


Previously Known Failures - Reoccurring
---------------------------------------

"dplyr"			change on our end, requiring updated test

"forecast"              _internal_ unit test error also present with Rcpp 0.12.7

"FSelectorRcpp"		test failure:
                           > test_check("FSelectorRcpp")
                           Segmentation fault (core dumped)

"gapfill"               possibly internal testing error

"kerpg"			test failure
                           Error in optim(par = parIni, fn = thisLogLikFun, gr = thisLogLikGrad,  : 
                             L-BFGS-B needs finite values of 'fn'
                           Error in .local(object, ...) : error in 'optim'

"mcPAFit"		internal build failure, importing unexported PAFit functions

"officer"		testthat failure, reason unclear

"rdist"			testthat failure, reason unclear


New
---

"hBayesDM" 		run-away compilation, killed, same version built earlier, pretty involved build
                        same issue with Rcpp 0.12.10 from CRAN -- likely not us

"mvnfast"               spurious numerical error in test


SUMMARY
=======

Maybe one new issue
