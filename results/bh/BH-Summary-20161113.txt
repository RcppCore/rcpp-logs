Brief Discussion
===================


Possibly issue
--------------

  textreuse             Test fails, passes with previous release; maintainer contacted


Non-issues
----------

  Rblpapi               Extended tests require Bbg access, can fail during off-hours

  rstan                 Compilation issue, possibly related to StanHeaders package; maintainer contacted

  rstanarm              Testing issue (seemingly) due to ggplot2 changes
