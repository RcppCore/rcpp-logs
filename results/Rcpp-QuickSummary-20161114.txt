Of those twelve

  - four seem ggplot2 related

  - five are recurring

  - two are spurious
  
  - one is unrelated

DETAILS

Previously Known Failures
-------------------------

"contoureR"             [again] _internal_ unit test error with qhull

"datafsm"		[again] Error in fitness(Pop[i, ], ...) : unused argument (maxfitness = 1)

"evolqg"                [CHECK AGAINST CRAN Rcpp] possible _internal_ unit test error between complex and numeric
                        [Same failure with Rcpp 0.12.5]

"forecast"              _internal_ unit test error also present with Rcpp 0.12.7

New failures
------------

"gapfill"               Test failure, plotting related, maybe ggplot2?

Spurious
--------

"ddR"                   fine in subsequent test

"sbrl"                  fine in subsequent test

Other
-----

"RQuantLib"             interaction with QL 1.9 ?
