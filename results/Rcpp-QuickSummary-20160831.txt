OVERVIEW
========

Rcpp 0.12.6.4 (with #527, #528, #529)

  0   1 
744  12 
 [1] "Compositional" "contoureR"     "datafsm"       "Directional"   "evolqg"
 [6]         "kergp"      "mice"        "move"          "rstanarm"     "sbrl"
[11]         "walkr"      "wand"         


Of those twelve, seven were due to missing depends or a stale local package (RcppZiggurat)


DETAILS
=======

Can Be Fixed Easily Via Dependencies
------------------------------------

"Compositional"         [spurious] RcppZiggurat cannot be loaded; passes once RcppZiggurat reinstalled

"Directional"           [spurious] RcppZiggurat cannot be loaded; passes once RcppZiggurat reinstalled

"mice"                  [internal] "Package 'pan' needed "

"move"                  [internal] "The package adehabitatHR can't be loaded, probably it needs to be installed"

"rstanarm"              [internal] "Package required but not available: ‘shinystan’"

"walkr"                 [internal] "Package required but not available: ‘shinystan’"

"wand"                  [libmagic-dev missing]


Other Issue Possibly Due to Package Itself
------------------------------------------

"contoureR"             [again] _internal_ unit test error with qhull

"datafsm"		[again] Error in fitness(Pop[i, ], ...) : unused argument (maxfitness = 1)

"evolqg"                [CHECK AGAINST CRAN Rcpp] possible _internal_ unit test error between complex and numeric
                        [Same failure with Rcpp 0.12.5]

"kergp"                 _internal_ unit test error with optim

"sbrl"                  [internal ?] seg.fault
