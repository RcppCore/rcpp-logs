[1] "bootTimeInference" "contoureR"  "datafsm"       "evolqg"
[5]          "forecast"  "humarray"    "kergp" "RcppExamples"
[9]         "RQuantLib"

Of those nine,

  - six were known previously and a 'constant'

  - two were introduced with the new date(time) vectors (which was active during the test)

  - only one is new: 'bootTimeInference"


DETAILS
=======
