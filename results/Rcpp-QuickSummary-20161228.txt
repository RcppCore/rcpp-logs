Of those fifteen

  - seven we have seen before 

  - three that are already fixed in new sglOptim / lsglm / msgl

  - five that are new and need changes in headers
  

DETAILS
=======


Previously Known Failures
-------------------------

"datafsm"		[again] Error in fitness(Pop[i, ], ...) : unused argument (maxfitness = 1)

"evolqg"                [CHECK AGAINST CRAN Rcpp] possible _internal_ unit test error between complex and numeric
                        [Same failure with Rcpp 0.12.5]

"forecast"              _internal_ unit test error also present with Rcpp 0.12.7

"gapfill"               Test failure, plotting related, maybe ggplot2?

"humarray"              _internal_ unit test error: 'couldn't reach t1dbase website at: http://www.immunobase.org/....'

"quanteda"              Test failure, plotting related, maybe ggplot2?

"stremr"                Test fails because _Suggested_ package h2oEnsemble (from a drat) missing

"lsgl"                  requires updated sglOptim

"msgl"                  requires updated sglOptim

"sglOptim"              requires updated sglOptim
