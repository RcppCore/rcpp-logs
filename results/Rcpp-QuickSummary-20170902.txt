Of these eight, most (all?) are known issues
  
  
DETAILS 
=======


"climdex.pcic"		possible internal test failure [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"ConConPiWiFun"         test failure, segfault, unclear [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"icosa"                 test failure [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"kerpg"			test failure
                           Error in optim(par = parIni, fn = thisLogLikFun, gr = thisLogLikGrad,  : 
                             L-BFGS-B needs finite values of 'fn'
                           Error in .local(object, ...) : error in 'optim'

"officer"		testthat failure, reason unclear

"rstan"                 known BH issue

"vdiffr"                Error in svglite_(file, bg, width, height, pointsize, standalone, aliases) : 
                          function 'gdtools_RcppExport_validate' not provided by package 'gdtools'

"Wmisc"                 possibly internal test failure [also with CRAN Rcpp]



SUMMARY
=======

Rcpp should be fine
