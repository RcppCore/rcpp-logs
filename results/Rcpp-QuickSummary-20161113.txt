Of those fifteen

  - two were known newDatetime issues

  - two were (new) BH related

  - four seem ggplot2 related

  - five are recurring

  - one seem internal to the package

  - leaving one to look at

DETAILS
=======


Previously Known Failures
-------------------------

"contoureR"             [again] _internal_ unit test error with qhull

"datafsm"		[again] Error in fitness(Pop[i, ], ...) : unused argument (maxfitness = 1)

"evolqg"                [CHECK AGAINST CRAN Rcpp] possible _internal_ unit test error between complex and numeric
                        [Same failure with Rcpp 0.12.5]

"forecast"              _internal_ unit test error also present with Rcpp 0.12.7

"humarray"              _internal_ unit test error: 'couldn't reach t1dbase website at: http://www.immunobase.org/....'

"rstan"                 This came up with BH ...

"textreuse"             This came up with BH ...

New failures
------------

"gapfill"               Test failure, plotting related, maybe ggplot2?

"quanteda"              Test failure, plotting related, maybe ggplot2?

"raptr"                 Test failure, unclear

"rstanarm"              Test failure, plotting related, maybe ggplot2?

"tesseract"             Test failures, "Error opening data file /usr/share/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/eng.traineddata"

"vdiffr"                Test failure, plotting related, maybe ggplot2?

Known Datetime transition issues
--------------------------------

"RcppExamples"          POSIXct transitions: "'origin' must be supplied"

"RQuantLib"             getDate needs change



SUMMARY
=======

No significant issues, maybe look into raptr
