OVERVIEW

Again Rcpp 0.12.7.2 (with #557), this time 'active'

 [1] "contoureR"    "datafsm"      "evolqg"       "forecast"     "humarray"     "kergp"
 [7] "openxlsx"     "Rblpapi"      "RcppExamples" "rpg"          "RQuantLib" 


Of those eleven,

  - six were known

  - four of five fail because of a missing `operator double()` which was since added.
