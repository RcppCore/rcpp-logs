OVERVIEW
========

Again Rcpp 0.12.7.5 (with "old" date[time] vectors)

  0   1
801   8
[1] "contoureR"  "datafsm"    "evolqg"     "forecast"   "humarray"   "kergp"      "Mposterior" "sf"

Of those nine,

  - six were known previously and a 'constant'

  - one was a runwaway simulation (Mposterior) killed after two+ hours

  - sf is a brandnew package and this looks internal to it


DETAILS
=======

New issue
---------

"sf"                    gdal_geom.cpp:49:19: error: ‘class OGRGeometry’ has no member named ‘DelaunayTriangulation’
    out[i] = g[i]->DelaunayTriangulation(dTolerance, bOnlyEdges);


Spurious
--------

Mposterior              killed after two hours
