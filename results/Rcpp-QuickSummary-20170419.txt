DETAILS
=======


Previously Known Failures - Reoccurring
---------------------------------------

"forecast"              _internal_ unit test error also present with Rcpp 0.12.7

"gapfill"               possibly internal testing error

"officer"		testthat failure, reason unclear

"rdist"			testthat failure, reason unclear

"Rsomoclu"              test issue with Rsomoclu.kohonen

"treatSens"		borked configure, fails to build at CRAN

New failures
------------

"dplyr"			change on our end:
                           error$message does not match "expecting a single value", 
                           Actual value: "Expecting a single value: [extent=2]."
                        fixable
                        
"rstanarm"              testthat error, may need to investigate

=======
