Of these fourteen, twelve are recurrent known issues -- and also failed with the preceding run with
Rcpp 0.12.12.  Two are new but fail with CRAN's Rcpp as well.
  
  
DETAILS 
=======

New but spurious
----------------

"EWGoF"                 core dumps, also reported some issue in CRAN checks; just idles with CRAN Rcpp

"netdiffuseR"           also core dumps; but passed when re-running (against either Rcpp)


Failed Before
-------------

"brms"			likely internal: "Failure: plotting functions don't throw unexpected errors" [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"climdex.pcic"		possible internal test failure [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"ConConPiWiFun"         test failure, segfault, unclear [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"icosa"                 test failure [also with CRAN Rcpp]

"kerpg"			test failure
                           Error in optim(par = parIni, fn = thisLogLikFun, gr = thisLogLikGrad,  : 
                             L-BFGS-B needs finite values of 'fn'
                           Error in .local(object, ...) : error in 'optim'

"officer"		testthat failure, reason unclear

"Rblpapi"               fails on the weekend, runs fine on Monday (== market data)

"rstan"                 known BH issue

"rstanarm"              possibly internal:  Error in new_CppObject_xp(fields$.module, fields$.pointer, ...) : no valid constructor available for the argument list [also with CRAN Rcpp]


"vdiffr"                Error in svglite_(file, bg, width, height, pointsize, standalone, aliases) : 
                          function 'gdtools_RcppExport_validate' not provided by package 'gdtools'

"VeryLargeIntegers"     possibly internal: segfault [also with CRAN Rcpp]


"Wmisc"                 possibly internal test failure [also with CRAN Rcpp]



SUMMARY
=======

Rcpp should be fine
